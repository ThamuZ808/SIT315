Quicksort:
Results:

Array size 30 Sequential: 5300 Nanoseconds
Array size 30 OpenMP:     5100 Nanoseconds

Using OpenMP with a small sample size of 30 seems to have made a tiny if not
uncalculable difference.


Array size 100000 sequential: 42453200 Nanoseconds
Array size 100000 OpenMP:     44410800 Nanoseconds

Even using a very large array size, it seems there is no noticeable speed
up using OpenMP. This could be because the only computation occuring
is comparing 2 ints which is extremely easy for modern CPUs.
